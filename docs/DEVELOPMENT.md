## Getting an executable into the emulator

Mount ImportFl in your emulator by dragging the file [importfl-1.2.2.dsk](../emulation/importfl-1.2.2.dsk) onto the emulator. [This program](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/extras/importfl/index.html) allows you to import any file from your computer into the emulator. An ImportFl icon will appear on your desktop. Clicking it twice opens a folder with an 'ImportFl' executable. Double clicking it will start the importing process. You can simply drag files onto your emulator to import them. Once you're doing quit by cmd + q.
